## Problem Statement:-

- In the template there are 3 input tags for and one select tag:-
  1.  Name -> input:text
  2.  Email -> input:email
  3.  Mobile -> input:number
  4.  Gender -> select
- There are also 4 input tags and 6 buttons.
- When clicked on the button with id:- `name-btn` the text typed in the name input tag should be visible in the h1 tag with id:- `dName`.
- These should happen for email,mobile & gender as well.
- Now when clicked on the button with id:- `resetText-btn` the text inside the h1 tags should become empty string.
- When clicked on the button with id:- `resetForm-btn` the input and select tags should reset.
